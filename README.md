## Introduction to Food crops
Crops are plants, or products made from plants, that are grown and harvested for subsistence or for profit. Crops are typically divided into six categories: food crops, feed crops, fiber crops, oil crops, ornamental crops, and industrial crops.

Food crops are subsistence crops that are meant for human consumption. They include fruits, vegetables, grains, and tubers, like potatoes. Grains, which include crops like wheat, rice, and corn, are the most popular crops in the world, with wheat as the most widely grown crop overall.

some of the factors affecting production of crops are Water, Wind, Sunlight, Temperature, Rainfall, Photosynthesis, Microbes increase the fertility of the soil and Pollinating agents. 

It is important to identify the best crop to grow in order to increase the production of the crops.
